## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to work with, flexbox, css grid, background images and mobile-first workflow.



```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image: url("assets/desktop/image-hero-left.png"),
    url("assets/desktop/image-hero-right.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-position: -3% 8rem, 105% 8rem;
  background-size: 50%, 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to improve in using HTML semantics, flebox, grid and background-images.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Test_your_skills_backgrounds_and_borders) - This helped me to better understand working with background images.
