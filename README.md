## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The main purpose of this challenge was to test the ability to use tools like flexbox, css grid, working with background images and media querys in order to view the optimal layout depending on users device's screen size. Here's a CSS snipet of working with multiple background images which i'm proud of:

```css
body {
  background-image: url("assets/desktop/image-hero-left.png"),
    url("assets/desktop/image-hero-right.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-position: -3% 8rem, 105% 8rem;
  background-size: 50%, 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to improve in using HTML semantics, flebox, grid and background-images.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Test_your_skills_backgrounds_and_borders) - This helped me to better understand working with background images.
